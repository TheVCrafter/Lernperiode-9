# Lernperiode-9
**20.02.2026 - 27.03.2026**

## Project Overview
In this learning period, I aim to build a **web-based Minecraft PvP Guide**.  
For the tech stack, I chose:

- **Backend:** Kotlin with the Ktor framework  
- **Frontend:** JavaScript with React  

The website should eventually provide:

- PvP guides for different combat styles  
- Interactive tools like CPS tests and aim trainers  
- Possibly user accounts and progress tracking  
- **An appealing, user-friendly design that is visually engaging but not overcomplicated**

**Goals**
- [ ]  Set up a minimal Ktor backend with a simple API route
- [ ]  Learn how Ktor handles routing, requests, and JSON responses
- [ ]  Create a basic React project and understand component structure
- [ ]  Connect the React frontend to the Ktor backend via a simple HTTP request
